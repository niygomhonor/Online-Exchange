## BDD

**The program should ask the user what task she want to execute.**

    System: "Would like to Encrypt or Decrypt a message"

**The program should accept input from the user.**

    System: "Would like to Encrypt or Decrypt a message"
    Input Example: Message: "Encrypt"

**The program should return when the user enter a message to be Encrpted** 

    System: "Would like to Encrypt or Decrypt a message"
    Input Example: Message: "Encrypt"
    System: " Write your message here ...."
    Input Example:  Message: "hello word"
    Sytem: "Write a shift value......"
    Input Example:2
    Output Example:  jgnnqyqtnf
    
**The program should return when the user enter a message to be Decrypted**

    Input Example: "jgnnqyqtnf"
